upstream does not provide a full package of source material
instead there are two downloads, a source and binary package, where the
source package is only the source for the c++ application and the binary
package contains two builds of this for linux, and two for windows, plus
the help files, component libraries, etc. and a copy of wings3d

the source package is 1.5mb and the binary package is 70mb, to avoid
including the full 70mb binary package in the debian source orig package
i have combined the full source package with the following components
from the binary package:
 * "modules" dir (except a couple of pdf datasheets) (10mb)
 * "library" dir (1.6mb)
 * "help" dir (32mb)
 * "demos" dir (3.2mb)
 * "internat" dir (2.4mb)
 * "template" dir (8k)
 * kicad_icon.png

in the future i hope the upstream author will improve this situation
