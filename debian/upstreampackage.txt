Upstream does not provide a full package of source material.
Instead there are two downloads, a source and binary package, where the
source package is only the c++ source and the binary package contains
two builds of this for linux, and two for windows, plus the help files,
component libraries, etc. and a copy of wings3d.

The source package is 1.5mb and the binary package is 70mb, to avoid
including the full 70mb binary package in the debian source orig package
I have combined the full source package with the following components
from the binary package:
 * "modules" dir (except a couple of pdf datasheets) (10mb)
 * "library" dir (1.6mb)
 * "help" dir (32mb)
 * "demos" dir (3.2mb)
 * "internat" dir (2.4mb)
 * "template" dir (8k)
 * news.txt

Remove execute permissions of loads of stuff that shouldn't have it.
find . -type f | xargs chmod a-x

In the future i hope the upstream author will improve this situation.
