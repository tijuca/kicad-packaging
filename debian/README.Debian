    Capacitors_ThroughHole.pretty       -> Capacitors_THT.pretty
    Connect.pretty                      -> Connectors.pretty
    Diodes_ThroughHole.pretty           -> Diodes_THT.pretty
    Display.pretty                      -> Displays.pretty
    Relays_ThroughHole.pretty           -> Relays_THT.pretty
    Resistors_ThroughHole.pretty        -> Resistors_THT.pretty
    Sockets_BNC.pretty                  -> Connectors_TE-Connectivity.pretty
    Sockets_Mini-Universal.pretty       -> Connectors_Mini-Universal.pretty
    Sockets_WAGO734.pretty              -> Connectors_WAGO.pretty
    Terminal_Blocks.pretty              -> Connectors_Terminal_Blocks.pretty
