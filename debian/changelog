  * [3fedd8b] copyright: explain why we need to add 'dfsg' suffix
    + From the Debian POV KiCad isn't fully free as upstream is shipping
      currently two PDF files without the sources. But there won't be ever
      sources for these files available, the files in question are from
      UltraCAD Inc. and they never will release the source for rebuilding the
      PDF files. We have removed the files to comply with the DFSG and this
      fact is added to the copyright file.

    + The added build dependency on libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev was added to get
      KiCad build against GTK3+ bindings but KiCad isn't fully ready and
      prepared to use the GTK3+ stuff so we need to go back to libwxgtk3.0
      with binding of GTK2+.
  * [9fe8b7e] debian/rules: turn off support of SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON
    + The scripting support engine needs wxpython which is currently only
      available with GTK3+ bindings. So if we turn on scripting support we
      will get a reverse dependency on libwxgtk3.0-gtk3 through wxpython.
      This would result again in used GTK3+ symbols inside the KiCad binaries
      and bring back the issues we had.

      liboce-ocaf-dev
  * [8234277] debian/rules: remove old libraries related stuff

  * [430ec11] debian/control: adjust VCS entries to salsa.debian.org
  * [5c54b36] kicad-doc-id: remove package
    + Unfortunately the Indonesian documentation was removed by upstream because
      of lack of contributors.
  * [20044b2] kicad: change package to multiarch behaviour
    + The 3D viewer is build as a local shared library plugin and this requires
      some modification for the correct installation of the kicad package files.
  * [422a784] debian/rules: disable the support of ngspice based simulation
    + For the schematic simulation we would need the libngspice library which
      isn't available in main yet. We can turn this later on once ngspice-dfsg
      is hitting main.
  * [63a280f] copyright: adopt upstream changes
    + Of course the upstream source has been modified in many places and thus
      the update of the copyright file is needed.
  * [7729f4d] kicad-libraries: adding new virtual package
    + The old kicad-common package was used to provide all the various libraries
      like the schematic symbols, footprints and the 3D models.
      As we have moved all the source of theses stuff into own source packages
      we don't have kicad-common now any longer as a dedicated binary package.
      So we created a meta-packge kicad-libraries that is depending on the
      library packages for the schematic symbols (kicad-symbols), the footprints
      (kicad-footprints) and the project templates (kicad-templates) which
      kicad-common is depending on because we need to take care about the
      automatic installation of the new library packages.
      The 3D models is not depending on kicad-libraries as this is not really
      needed to create successful PCBs, it's suggested instead.
  * [0a8e611] kicad-common: turn package into a virtual package
  * [ebcd0cd] remove kicad-common sequencer files
  * [5739a23] d/kicad.install.in: update sequencer due upstream changes
    + kicad-common isn't a real binary package now and most of it's installation
      parts need now move over to the kicad binary package. Also KiCad is
      installing now some private libraries.
  * [600079f] kicad.lintian-overrides: add some more false positives
    + We have some spelling issues which are false positives, also the library
      libkicad_3dsg.so.2.0.0 isn't worth to get a own binary package.
  * [4773043] debian/control: increase Standards-Version to 4.1.3
    + No further changes are needed due version bump.
  * [c277cc5] kicad: remove a potentially RUNPATH from Pyhton2 lib
    + The library _pcbnew.so, which is also copied over to the Python libraries,
      has a RUNPATH inside which shouldn't be set here. Upstream will fix this
      in future releases.
  * [be3e60d] kicad-demos: adding new package
    + Beside the new schematic and footprint library related packages we also
      split off the demo projects, they doesn't change that often but Ubuntu
      is using already this package, so let's do it also and keep both
      distribution the packages in sync. This is mostly to make the usage of the
      PPA from Jean-Samuel esay for Ubuntu users.
  * [be54a40] bump debhelper compat to version 11
    + Jump over to the recent debhelper version, it's now already available for
      backports so nothing special handling later will be needed,
  * [2211a92] kicad: suggesting package kicad-packages3d
    (Closes: #883312)

      longer within src:kicad.
  * [a4d8f6a] autopkg: remove the only existing autopkgtest
    + We don't need the autopkg stuff for now, we can re-add it later if needed.
