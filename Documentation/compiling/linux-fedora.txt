Fedora 14
---------

First we need to install all the needed tools and libraries with yum. First
become root with su.

Then invoke yum:
yum install gcc gcc-c++ bzr cmake doxygen wxGTK-devel make

Create somewhere on your drive a kicad directory.

Then clone the bzr repository:
bzr checkout lp:kicad testing

then cd into the build directory
invoke cmake to generate the makefiles

cmake ../testing

If everything went well you should be able to build kicad with make.

make
