Here is the proposed copyright message to be added to all source files
at their top.  There is one line that represents the main copyright holder
and that would be Jean-Pierre Charras for existing modules.  

But in the future, the respective author of any newly coded module would be
listed as the main copyright holder. Additional workers who might earn a
partial copyright holder status of the respective module are simply left in the
change_log.txt file, see the 2nd Copyright line below.

Jean-Pierre, let me know if this is satisfactory and I will run a script I have to 
pre-pend it to all the sources.   

Thanks, Dick Hollenbeck dick@softplc.com.
