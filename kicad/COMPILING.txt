--== How to build kicad using CMAKE ==--
First Written: 19-Dec-2007

Kicad needs wxWidgets, the multi platform G.U.I.

Perform these steps in sequence. (Platform specific details are given in
sections below.)


1)  If windows, then install "msys" and "mingw".
2)  If linux, then install "mesa".
3)  Make sure g++ and "make" are in your path.
4)  Install wxWidgets [and build it if on windows].
5)  Install zlib [and build it if on windows].
6)  Install CMAKE
7)  Install Boost C++ Template Libraries (*.hpp files)
8)  Install the kicad source tree.
9)  Use cmake to build the kicad makefiles.
10) Use make to build and install kicad.
11) Making a "Debug" build.
12) Variables for fine-tuning the build process.


===== Step Details ====================================================

1)  If windows, then install "msys" and "mingw".
Skip this step if on a Unix box.  Get msys and mingw here:
http://mingw.org/
msys sets up a development environment that allows the bash shell to run.
mingw are a set of tools that run on windows or under msys.  You will need
at least the following mingw packages: make, gcc, g++, binutils, autoconf, and
automake.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)  If linux, install "mesa".  Use your package manager to install the development
libaries.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)  Make sure g++ and "make" are in your path.
If windows, then try running g++ and make from within your msys bash shell.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4)  Install wxWidgets [and build it if on windows].
If on windows, download
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxMSW-2.8.8.zip or a newer version.
Start msys so you have a bash shell.  Decide where your wxWidgets build directory
will be.  It must be where you can access it from within the msys environment,
such as home/<user>.   Edit your msys/1.0/etc/fstab file if needed to provide
access to this build directory from msys.  (Note that if you want you can build
a "debug" version of the wxWidgets library at this point, instead of the release
version, or in addition to the the release version.)
Unzip the wmMWS zip file into the build directory.  Change directories into there,
and then:

    mkdir build-release
    mkdir build-debug

-- release
    cd build-release
    ../configure --enable-unicode --enable-monolithic --disable-shared --with-msw --with-opengl
    make
    make install

-- debug
    cd build-debug
    ../configure --enable-unicode --enable-monolithic --enable-debug --enable-debug_gdb --disable-shared --with-msw --with-opengl
    make
    make install

I think the default is to install into /usr/local/wxMSW-2.8.8.  You can probably
pass --prefix=<wxInstallDir> to configure above to change where "make install"
puts everything.  We will refer to <wxInstallDir> again below.  Without the
--prefix=<wxInstallDir> passed to configure, <wxInstallDir> will likely be
    /usr/local/wxMSW-2.8.8

Verify that wx-config is in your path.  Modify your PATH environment variable
if need be so you can run wx-config from a command prompt.  You may have to
restart your msys shell, depending on how you modify your PATH.


If on linux, use your package manager to install shared object libraries and the
development versions of the wxWidgets packages which include the C++ headers. An
alternative is to build static libaries from source. Verify that wx-config is in
your path by running it from a command prompt. Linux users then go to next step.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5)  Install zlib [and build it if on windows].
If on windows, download http://www.zlib.net/zlib123.zip or a newer version.
Start msys so you have a bash shell. Decide where your zlib build directory
will be. It must be where you can access it from within the msys environment,
such as home/<user>. Edit your msys/1.0/etc/fstab file if needed to provide
access to this build directory from msys. Unzip the zlib123.zip file into this
build directory. Change directories into there, and then:
    ./configure
    make
    make install


If linux, use your package manager to install zlib pre-built binaries.

Note (JP Charras):
	Under Linux, zlib is usually installed.
	if not found by wxWidget installation, wxWidgets creates an alternate zlib
	Under Windows, zlib is not installed, so my cmake buld try to use the wxWidgets zlib build.
	So, under windows kicad build should work without zlib install.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6)  Install CMAKE.
If windows, download the installation binary for windows from cmake.org.
Install that and choose to add cmake to your path during installation.  You
will have to restart and command shells for the new path to take effect.
Verify that cmake is in your path by trying to run it from a command prompt.


If linux, use your package manager to install cmake. You should get cmake 2.4.7
or later. If only an older one is available in your package repository, build
2.4.7 from source. Verify that cmake is in your path by trying to run it from a
command prompt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7)  Install Boost C++ Libraries
If windows, well I'm guessing, so somebody please try these two options and
correct this text please according to which ever is easier:
(optionA) Go to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586
and download boost_1_34_1.zip or later and unzip it so as to put the files
into C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_34_1
(optionB)
Go to http://www.boost-consulting.com/products/free
and download the http://www.boost-consulting.com/boost_1_34_1_setup.exe
file and run it.

If linux, and using a GCC earlier than 4.2, then install the
"Boost C++ Libraries development files" or similarly named package using your
package manager. Note that if you are using gcc 4.2 or later, there were
incompatibilities that exist between boost 1.34.1 and gcc 4.2. So in this case,
instead of installing boost using your package manager, you should use the svn
HEAD copy which overcomes the gcc 4.2 incompatibility, specifically with
<boost/ptr_container/ptr_vector.hpp>.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8)  Install the kicad source tree.
You can use the subversion repository or a tar file for this.  See the wiki.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9)  Use cmake to create the kicad makefiles.
If windows, go into your msys shell.  Linux and windows users both then make
two "out of source" build directories:
    cd <kicadSource>
    mkdir -p build/release
    mkdir build/debug
    cd build/release

On either cmake command line shown below, you can optionally include
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<finallInstallDir>

If windows, run the following command:
    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DwxWidgets_ROOT_DIR=<wxInstallDir> ../../

If linux, run instead the following command:
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../../

Take a look at CMakeCache.txt, and in particular CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, which
gives the final install directory. If not what you want, edit it with a text
editor and re-run the same cmake command again, but with no
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX given on the command line.

CMake will try and find the boost header files and will often fail.  If it
fails, you will have to edit your CMakeCache.txt file manually and set your
Boost_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/svn/boost-trunk
setting to point to the base of the boost installation directory.  Account
for the fact that the boost #include references use a <boost/..> type prefix.
Example C++ code:  #include <boost/ptr_container/ptr_vector.hpp> and please
notice the leading <boost/ in the path.
So point your Boost_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH= variable to a directory above the
"boost" directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10)  Use make to build and install kicad.
You compile Kicad here.  You will only need to do step 8) again when one of the
CMakeLists.txt files change.  If windows, you must be in your msys shell.
On either platform then:
    cd <kicadSource>/build/release
    make
    [sudo] make install

You are now done unless you want to make a Debug build.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11) Making a "Debug" build.

    cd <kicadSource>/build/debug

On either cmake command line shown below, you can optionally include
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<finallInstallDir> before the final ../../ argument. Although
normally you do not install the Debug binaries, you can debug them where they
were built.

If windows, run the following command:
    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DwxWidgets_USE_DEBUG=ON -DwxWidgets_ROOT_DIR=<wxInstallDir> ../../

If linux, run instead the following command:
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DwxWidgets_USE_DEBUG=ON ../../

Make the Debug binaries:
    make

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

12) Variables for fine-tuning the build process.

These should be set from command line:

 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release/Debug (REQUIRED)
   Choose build type: Release/Debug.

 wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG ON/OFF (REQUIRED)
   Should be set to ON only when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug.

 wxWidgets_USE_STATIC ON/OFF (OPTIONAL)


 CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE ON/OFF (OPTIONAL)
   Turns ON/OFF verbose build messages.
   You can also pass VERBOSE=1 to make for the same effect.

 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (OPTIONAL)


 KICAD_MINIZIP ON/OFF


 KICAD_PYTHON ON/OFF


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: that it is easy to build only a specific binary such as pcbnew alone:
    make pcbnew

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

End of CMAKE related building.


============= OLD STUFF NOT PERTINENT TO CMAKE ==============================

unzip sources in a working directory.
This will create the directory "kicad-dev".

First you must install wxWidgets (see www.wxWidgets.org)
See below for suggested configure command.

Linux compilation:
You must have:
wxWidgets ( I suggest you install wxWidgets in /usr/local).
(see below for suggested configure command, then make and make install)

Mesa: pcbnew and cvpcv need openGL or mesa.
(you must install mesa devel if libGL et libGLU are not found).
GTK 2 (install development libraries).

Because old version of Mesa has problem under a recent linux distrib (mandarke 10.1),
I am using Mesa version 6.2.1, statically compiled, installed in /usr/local
Mesa installation:
Get MesaLib-6.2.1.tar.gz from http://www.mesa3d.org/
in /usr/local : tar zxvf MesaLib-6.2.1.tar.gz
in /usr/local/Mesa-6.2.1 :
make linux-x86-static
make install ( libGL.a et libGLU.a are copied in /usr/local/lib, and header in /usr/local/include)

kicad compilation:
in kicad-dev:
 Have a look to libs.linux (you can/must edit this file if you have problems)
 Currently libs.linux uses wxWidgets 2.8.6 build (see below for suggested configure command)
 lines to edit:
 STD_INSTALL = 1
 which can be (see comments in libs.linux)
 STD_INSTALL = 0 (or 2)

 after libs.linux edition:
 run make -f makefile.gtk

Windows compilation:

kicad is build with mingw and msys.
Currently libs.win uses wxWidgets 2.8.6 (see below for suggested configure command)

install mingw  and msys ( see mingw.org )
(opengl libs are included in mingw or windows)

Under msys:
    (Warning: make.exe utility is sometime renamed mingw32-make.exe in install process
    of msys.)

Build wxWidgets (currently version 2.8.6)
    See below for suggested configure command, then make

    In include/wx/msw/setup.h, check (and edit if needed) the defines :
    #define wxUSE_GLCANVAS       1
    #define wxUSE_MOUSEWHEEL  1 // Include mouse wheel support
    #define wxUSE_HOTKEY 0      // Hotkey support (currently Windows only)


Exit msys.
Set environment variable WXWIN ( something as wxwin=/d/wxWidgets-2.8.6
for a wxWidget installed in d:\wxWidgets-2.8.6)

Have a look to libs.win (Currently this file handle wxWidgets 2.8.6)

Under msys:
    in kicad-dev:
    run make -f makefile.g95
