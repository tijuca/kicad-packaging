Here are some source code maintenance tasks that need to be done, and maybe some
folks will see these items and volunteer to do them.


*** @todo: grep for @todo and finish off those tasks, scattered throughout the source.


*** use BOARD_ITEM::MenuIcon() in the onrightclick.cpp


*** Use DOXYGEN compatible comments on member functions.  As configured,
Doxygen gives priority to comments in header files over *.cpp files.
Review the generated docs and start to go through the source and make the
generated doxygen docs readable and clear using the JavaDoc style comments,
mostly in the header files.  The error and warning output of the doxygen
compiler can help with this too.

*** GerbView
Need support for drill files like Excellon, the best is to write small library for parsing
and displaying it.

*** CVPCB
Add preference (checkbox) to close cvpcb after saving netlist instead of automatic
close after saving netlist, because this is not normal program behavoir to quit
after save.

*** Translate comments that are in French to English so there can be a broader
understanding by new developers.


*** Add tooltip text to all non-obvious controls in every dialog window.
Need to do this using DialogBlocks.

PCBNEW Unroute function in rightclick menu (for component)

---Message---
Hi all,
It's would be nice to have on right click menu (on component) "unroute
component".Currently, to do this, I use the deletion of the block but it's
not good for that.
(sample: popupmenu -> U10 -> Move,Drag....Unroute)
thanks if you can do this.

1) Gerbview needs to work at least as well as gerv, that means adding named layers,
   and a list control to sort the layer stack on the fly.  There seems to be a polygon bug
   of some kind, don't know how long that's been in there.  (Dick)
2) Add net class support to PCBNEW, so the round tripping to freerouter
   is a dream (Dick)
3) Document the specctra round tripper, and fix up the english translation
   of help.  (Dick, native english speaker)
4) Expose layer name editing in pcbnew (anyone), should dove tail with net
   class editor from a UI perspective.

** Should probably switch gerbview to use ZONE instead of SEGZONE for polygons.
** Need to add ARC support to gerber polygons.
** Need to add polygon aperture type.  Then example 2 in RS274xrevd_e.pdf will draw properly.

specctra:
Add net class support to pcbnew so that the export to specctra becomes richer.
A netclass should hold a list of nets, track width, track spacing,
via drill size and via copper diameter.
