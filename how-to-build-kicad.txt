How to build kicad:

kicad do not use configure (not yet...)
it is compiled with make.

kicad needs wxWidgets (the multi platform G.U.I.)

unzip sources in a working directory.
This will create the directory "kicad-dev".

First you must install wxWidgets (see www.wxWidgets.org)
See mybuild_wxWidgets_linux.txt and mybuild_wxWidgets_windows.txt
(in kicad-dev ) which are scripts running configure for both systems.

Linux compilation:
You must have:
wxWidgets ( I suggest you install wxWidgets in /usr/local).
(you can copy wxWidgets_linux.txt in wxWidgets directory an run
sh wxWidgets_linux.txt
and make and make install)

Mesa: pcbnew and cvpcv need openGL or mesa.
(you must install mesa devel if libGL et libGLU are not found).
GTK 2 (install development libraries).

Because old version of Mesa has problem under a recent linux distrib (mandarke 10.1),
I am using Mesa version 6.2.1, statically compiled, installed in /usr/local
Mesa installation:
Get MesaLib-6.2.1.tar.gz from http://www.mesa3d.org/
in /usr/local : tar zxvf MesaLib-6.2.1.tar.gz
in /usr/local/Mesa-6.2.1 :
make linux-x86-static
make install ( libGL.a et libGLU.a are copied in /usr/local/lib, and header in /usr/local/include)

kicad compilation:
in kicad-dev:
 Have a look to libs.linux (you can edit this file if you have problems)
 Currently libs.linux uses wxWidgets 2.6.2 build with script "mybuild_wxWidgets_linux.txt"
 or  "mybuild_wxWidgets_linux_unicode.txt"
 run make -f makefile.gtk

Windows compilation:

kicad is build with mingw and msys.

install mingw  and msys ( see mingw.org )
(opengl libs are included in mingw or windows)

Under msys:
	(Warning: make.exe utility is sometime renamed mingw32-make.exe in install process
	of msys.)
	
Build wxWidgets:
	-> currently, my build version is 2.6.3, with or without unicode support
	you can copy wxWidgets_windows.txt or wxWidgets_windows_unicode.txt
	in wxWidgets directory an run sh wxWidgets_linux.txt (or wxWidgets_windows_unicode.txt)
	and make

	In include/wx/setup.h, check (and edit if needed) the defines :
	#define WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_4 0
	#define wxUSE_MOUSEWHEEL 1  // Include mouse wheel support
	#define wxUSE_HOTKEY 0      // disable Hotkey support (currently Windows only)
	#define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 1    // to use OpenGL


Exit msys.
Set environment variable WXWIN ( something as wxwin=/d/wxWidgets-2.6.0
for a wxWidget installed in d:\wxWidgets-2.6.0)

Have a look to libs.win (Currently this file handle wxWidgets 2.6.0)

Under msys:
	in kicad-dev:
	run make -f makefile.g95
