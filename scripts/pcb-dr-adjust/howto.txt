Dr:: 0,400,400;
ShC:: 0,700,600,0,900,900
ShR:: 0,0,0,0,0,0
ShO:: 0,0,0,0,0,0
Vias:: 0,700,600,0,400,400
infile: example.brd
outfile: processed.brd

1. edit a copy of configuration file 'pcb-dr-adjust.cfg' in project folder
  a. Dr:: from,to,result:from_2,to_2,result_2
     Replaces all drills (from...to] with 'result' value
  b. Sh[C,R,O]:[|locked]: fromX,toX,resultX,fromY,toY,resultY; e.t.c.
     C,R,O - different types of pads
     locked/unlocked - process X and Y only if both checks match/independently
  c. Vias:: the same as Shapes
  d. infile: your_board_filename
  e. outfile: your_out_filename
     Should be not the same as infile now.
2. run pcb-dr-adjust.pl. Under Windows - download ActivePerl from http://activestate.com
   Undex *nix - chmod 755 pcb-dr-adjust.cfg, execute "./pcb-dr-adjust.pl" or "path-to-svn/scripts/pcb-dr-adjust/pcb-dr-adjust.pl"
3. take a look at outfile and rename it manually if correct.


P.S. Next release I will add "make install" to *nix,*win32 makefiles to install it to bin folder.
     I will try to make this tool as good as time permit. Any contributions welcome!

Enjoy!
