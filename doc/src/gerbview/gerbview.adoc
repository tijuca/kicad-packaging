== Introduction to GerbView

GerbView is a Gerber file (RS-274X format) and Excellon drill file
viewer. Up to 32 files can be displayed at once.

For more information about the Gerber file format please read
http://www.ucamco.com/files/downloads/file/81/the_gerber_file_format_specification.pdf[the Gerber File Format Specification].
Details about drill file format can be found at
http://web.archive.org/web/20071030075236/http://www.excellon.com/manuals/program.htm[the Excellon format description].

=== Layers Manager

image::images/gerbview_layer_manager.png[scaledwidth="40%",alt="gerbview_layer_manager_png"]

The Layers Manager controls and displays visibility of all layers. An arrow
indicates the active layer, and each layer can be shown or hidden with
the checkboxes.

Mouse button assignments:

* Left click: select the active layer
* Right click: show/hide/sort layers options
* Middle click (on color swatch): select the layer color

== Commands in menu bar

=== File menu

image::images/gerbview_file_menu.png[scaledwidth="45%",alt="gerbview_file_menu_png"]

* *Export to Pcbnew* is a limited capability to export Gerber files into
Pcbnew. The final result depends on what features of the RS-274X format
are used in the original Gerber files: rasterized items cannot be converted
(typically negative objects), flashed items are converted to vias, lines are
converted to track segments (or graphic lines for non-copper layers).

=== Preferences menu

image::images/gerbview_preferences_menu.png[scaledwidth="33%",alt="gerbview_preferences_menu_png"]

=== Miscellaneous menu

image::images/gerbview_misc_menu.png[scaledwidth="25%",alt="gerbview_misc_menu_png"]

* *List DCodes* shows the D Code information for all layers.
* *Show Source* displays the Gerber file contents of the active layer in a
  text editor.
* *Clear Layer* erases the contents of the active layer.

== Display modes

GerbView has three display modes which are useful for different
situations or requirements.

NOTE: Stacked mode and Transparency mode provide a better graphical
experience, but may be slower then Raw mode on some computers.

=== Raw mode

This mode is selected by
image:images/icons/gbr_select_mode0.png[gbr_select_mode0_png].
Each file and each item in the file are drawn in the order files are
loaded. However, the active layer is drawn last.

When Gerber files have negative items (drawn in black), artifacts may be
visible on already-drawn layers.

image::images/gerbview_mode_raw_stack.png[scaledwidth="60%",alt="gerbview_mode_raw_stack_png"]

=== Stacked mode

Invoked by image:images/icons/gbr_select_mode1.png[gbr_select_mode1_png],
each file is drawn in the order files are loaded. Again, the active
layer is drawn last.

When Gerber files have negative items (drawn in black) there are no
artifacts on already-drawn layers because this mode draws each file in
a local buffer before it is shown on screen.

image::images/gerbview_mode_raw_stack.png[scaledwidth="60%",alt="gerbview_mode_raw_stack_png"]

=== Transparency mode

Use image:images/icons/gbr_select_mode2.png[gbr_select_mode2_png] to display in this
mode, where no artifacts are present and layers are blended together with the active
layer on top.

image::images/gerbview_mode_transparency.png[scaledwidth="60%",alt="gerbview_mode_transparency_png"]

=== Layer occlusion

In raw or stacked mode, the active layer will be on top of other layers
and hide items below it.

Here, layer 1 (green) is the active layer (note the triangle next to it)
and so it is drawn on top of layer 2 (blue):

image::images/gerbview_layer_select_1.png[scaledwidth="60%",alt="gerbview_layer_select_1_png"]

Making layer 2 (blue) the active layer brings it to the top:

image::images/gerbview_layer_select_2.png[scaledwidth="60%",alt="gerbview_layer_select_2_png"]

== Moving items

Items may be selected by holding down the left mouse button and drawing a
rectangle. Releasing the button picks up the items. A click of the left
mouse button places the items.

== Printing

To print layers, use the
image:images/icons/print_button.png[print_button_png]
icon or the *File -> Print* menu.

[CAUTION]
========================================
Be sure items are inside the printable area. Use
image:images/icons/sheetset.png[sheetset_png] to select a
suitable page format.

Note that many photoplotters support a large plottable area, much
bigger than the page sizes used by most printers. Moving the entire
layer set may be required.
