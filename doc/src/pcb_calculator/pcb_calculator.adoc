[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The Kicad Calculator gives you the Chance to calculate the most important Things without leaving Kicad.

The Calculator consists the following Options:

* Regulators
* Track Width
* Electrical Spacing
* Trans Line
* RF Attenuators
* Color Code
* Board Classes

== Calculators

[[regulators]]
=== Regulators

This calculator helps with the task of finding the values of the resistors
needed for linear and low-dropout voltage regulators.

For the _Standard Type_, the output voltage V_out as a function of the reference voltage V_ref and resistors R_1 and R_2 is given by:

For the _3 terminal type_, there is a correction factor due to the quiescent current I_adj flowing from the adjust pin:

This current is typically below 100 uA and can be neglected with caution.

To use this calculator, enter the parameters of the regulator _Type_, _V_ref_ and, if needed, _I_adj_, select the field you want to calculate (one of the resistors or the output voltage) and enter the other two values.


[[track-width]]
=== Track-Width

The Track Width calculator calculates the trace width for printed circuit board conductors for a given current.
It uses formulas from IPC-2221 (formerly IPC-D-275).

[[electrical-spacing]]
=== Electrical-Spacing

In the Picture you can see that you can edit the Voltage and the Calculator gives you the correct Values.

The minimal Values which orientatd at the IPC-2221 too.

[[transline]]
=== TransLine

Transmission line theory is a cornerstone in the teaching of RF and microwave engineering.

In the Calculator you can choose different sorts of Line Types and their special Parameters.

[[rf-attenuators]]
=== RF-Attenuators

With the RF Attenuator you can calculate different things by choosing:

* PI
* Tee
* Bridged Tee
* Resistive Splitter

and change all their Parameters.

[[color-code]]
=== Color-Code

This calculator helps translating the color bars from the resistor to its value. To use it, first select the _tolerance_ of the resistor: 10%, 5% or equal or smaller than 2%. For example:

* Yellow Violet Red Gold: 4 7 x100 Â±5% = 4700 Ohm, 5% tolerance
* 1kOhm, 1% tolerance: Brown Black Black Brown Brown
