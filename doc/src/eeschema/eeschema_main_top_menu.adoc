[[manage-sym-lib-table]]
==== Manage Symbol Library Tables

image::images/en/options_symbol_lib.png[alt="Symbol Library Tables",scaledwidth="50%"]

Eeschema uses two library tables to store the list of available symbol libraries,
which differ by the scope:

* Global Libraries

Libraries listed in the Global Libraries table are available to every project.
They are saved in *sym-lib-table* in your home directory (exact path is
dependent on the operating system; check the path above the table).

* Project Specific Libraries

Libraries listed in Project Specific Libraries table are available to the
currently opened project. They are saved in *sym-lib-table* file in the project
directory (check the path above the table).

You can view either list by clicking on "Global Libraries" or "Project Specific
Libraries" tab below the library table.

===== Add a new library

Add a library either by clicking *Browse Libraries...* button and selecting a
file or clicking "Append Library" and typing a path to a library file. The
selected library will be added to the currently opened library table
(Global/Project Specific).

===== Remove a library

Remove a library by selecting one or more libraries and clicking *Remove
Library* button.

===== Library properties

Each row in the table stores several fields describing a library:

[cols="30%,70%",]
|======================
| Active| Enables/disables the library. It is useful to temporarily reduce the loaded library set.
| Nickname| Nickname is a short, unique identifier used for assigning symbols to components. Symbols
are represented by '<Library Nickname>:<Symbol Name>' strings.
| Library Path| Path points to the library location.
| Plugin Type| Determines the library file format.
| Options| Stores library specific options, if used by plugin.
| Description| Briefly characterizes the library contents.

grids are used for component building.

|Bus thickness |Pen size used to draw buses.

|Line thickness |Pen size used to draw objects that do not have a
specified pen size.

|Part ID notation |Style of suffix that is used to denote symbol units (U1A,
U1.A, U1-1, etc.)

|Icon scale| Adjust toolbar icons size.

|Show Grid | Grid visibility setting.

|Restrict buses and wires to H and V orientation| If checked, buses and
wires are drawn only with vertical or horizontal lines.
Otherwise buses and wires can be placed at any orientation.

|Show hidden pins: |Display invisible (or __hidden__) pins, typically
power pins.

|Show page limits |If checked, shows the page boundaries on screen.
