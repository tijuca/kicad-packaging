== Generic Eeschema commands

Commands can be executed by:

* Clicking on the menu bar (top of screen).
* Clicking on the icons on top of the screen (general commands).
* Clicking on the icons on the right side of the screen (particular
  commands or "tools").
* Clicking on the icons on the left side of the screen (display
  options).
* Pressing the mouse buttons (important complementary commands). In
  particular a right click opens a contextual menu for the
  element under the cursor (Zoom, grid and editing of the elements).
* Function keys (F1, F2, F3, F4, Insert and Space keys).
  Specifically: Escape key cancels the command in progress.
  Insert key allows the duplication of the last element created.
* Pressing hot keys which typically perform a select tool command and begin
  tool action at the current cursor location.  For a list of hot keys, see
  the "Help->List Hotkeys" menu entry or press '?' key.

=== Mouse commands

==== Basic commands

*Left button*

* Single click: displays the characteristics of the component or text
  under the cursor in the status bar.
* Double click: edit (if the element is editable) the component or text.

*Right button*

* Opens a pop-up menu.

==== Block operations

You can move, drag, copy and delete selected areas in all Eeschema
menus.

Areas are selected by drawing a box around items using the left mouse button.

Holding "Shift", "Ctrl", or "Shift + Ctrl" during selection respectively
performs copying, dragging and deletion:

[width="80%",cols="66%,34%",]
|======================================================
|left mouse button |Move selection.
|Shift + left mouse button |Copy selection.
|Ctrl + left mouse button |Drag selection.
|Ctrl + Shift + left mouse button |Delete selection.
|======================================================

When dragging or copying, you can:

* Click again to place the elements.
* Click the right button or press Escape key to cancel.

If a block move command has started, another command can be
selected using the right-click pop-up menu.

=== Hotkeys

* The "?" key displays the current hotkey list.
* Hotkeys might be redefined in Controls tab of Schematic Editor Options dialog (menu Preferences -> General Options).

Here is the default hotkey list:

All hotkeys can be redefined using the hotkey editor (menu Preferences->General
Options-><<preferences-controls,Controls>>).

It is possible to import/export hotkey settings using menu Preferences->Import
and Export->Import/Export Hotkeys.

=== Grid

In Eeschema the cursor always moves over a grid. The grid can be customized:

- Size might be changed using the pop-up menu or using the Preferences/Options menu.
- Color might be changed in Colors tab of the Schematic Editor Options dialog (menu Preferences -> General Options).
- Visibility might be switched using the left-hand toolbar button.

The default grid size is 50 mil (0.050") or 1,27 millimeters.

This is the preferred grid to place components and wires in a schematic,
and to place pins when designing a symbol in the Symbol Editor.

One can also work with a smaller grid from 25 mil to 10 mil.
This is only intended for designing the symbol body
or placing text and comments and not recommended for placing pins and wires.

=== Zoom selection

To change the zoom level:

* Right click to open the Pop-up menu and select the desired zoom.

* Or use the function keys:

  ** F1: Zoom in

  ** F2: Zoom out

  ** F4 or simply click on the middle mouse button (without moving the mouse): Center the view around the cursor pointer position

* Window Zoom:

  ** Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out

  ** Shift+Mouse wheel: Pan up/down

  ** Ctrl+Mouse wheel: Pan left/right

=== Displaying cursor coordinates

The display units are in inches or millimeters. However, Eeschema always
uses 0.001 inch (mil/thou) as its internal unit.

The following information is displayed at the bottom right hand side of
the window:

* The zoom factor
* The absolute position of the cursor
* The relative position of the cursor

The relative coordinates can be reset to zero by pressing Space. This is
useful for measuring distance between two points or aligning objects.

=== Top menu bar

The top menu bar allows the opening and saving of schematics,
program configuration and viewing the documentation.

image::images/en/menu_bar.png[alt="menubar",scaledwidth="70%"]

=== Upper toolbar

This toolbar gives access to the main functions of Eeschema.

If Eeschema is run in standalone mode, this is the available tool set:

Note that when KiCad runs in project mode, the first two icons are not available
as they work with individual files.

hierarchical subsheets. It will create hierarchical pins corresponding to hierarchical
labels placed in the target subsheet.

|image:images/icons/add_hierar_pin.png[icons/add_hierar_pin_png]
|Place a hierarchical pin in a subsheet. This command can be executed only on
