= KiCad flowchart editing and export instructions

== Editing

The kicad_flowchart.dia file can be opened with the free and open-source
application Dia. Please note that since .dia files are just XML text
files, some editing could be done, sometimes more effectively, with the
aid of a simple text editor.

NOTE: The flowchart uses PNG files which are exported from bitmap SVG files.
The resolution of each PNG file used is exactly 40 x 40 pixels.

== Exporting

When exporting a Dia file please choose: "PNG (anti-aliased)" as the file
format before pressing the Save button.

When a pop-up appears with Export options, enter width '1150'. Press Export.

Please note that since the exporting options of Dia are very scarce, if
you encounter any issues during this operation it is still possible to
obtain the same kind of image file (PNG) using Inkscape instead of Dia.
