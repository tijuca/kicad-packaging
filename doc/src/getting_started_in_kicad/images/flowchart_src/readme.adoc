= KiCad flowchard editing and export instructions

== How-to use

The kicad_flowchart.dia can be opened with the free and open-source
application Dia. Please note that since che .dia files are just xml text
files, some editing could be done, sometimes more effectively, with the
aid of a simple text editor.

NOTE: In the flowchart I use png files which are exported from the bitmap svg files.
The resolution of each PNG file used, is exactly 40 x 40 pixels.

== Exporting

When you exporting the Dia file, please,
choose: "PNG (anti-aliased)" as file format before pressing the Save button.

When a pop-up appears with Export options, enter width: '1150'. Press Export.

Please note that, since the exporting options of Dia are very scarce, if
you encounter any issue during this operation it is still possible to
obtain the same kind of image file (PNG) using Inkscape instead of Dia.
