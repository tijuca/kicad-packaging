== General operations

=== Toolbars and commands

In Pcbnew it is possible to execute commands using various means:

* Text-based menu at the top of the main window.

* Top toolbar menu.

* Right toolbar menu.

* Left toolbar menu.

* Mouse buttons (menu options). Specifically:

** The right mouse button reveals a pop-up menu the content of
   which depends on the element under the mouse arrow.

* Keyboard (Function keys `F1`, `F2`, `F3`, `F4`, `Shift`, `Delete`, `+`, `-`, `Page Up`,
  `Page Down` and `Space bar`). The `Escape` key generally cancels an
  operation in progress.

The screenshot below illustrates some of the possible accesses to these
operations:

image::images/Right-click_legacy_menu.png[scaledwidth="70%"]

=== Mouse commands

==== Basic commands

* Left button

** Single-click displays the characteristics of the footprint or text under
   the cursor in the lower status bar.

** Double-click displays the editor (if the element is editable) of the
   element under the cursor.

* Centre button/wheel

** Rapid zoom and some commands in layer manager.

** Hold down the centre button and draw a rectangle to zoom to the
   described area. Rotation of the mouse wheel will allow you to zoom
   in and zoom out.

* Right button

** Displays a pop-up menu

==== Operations on blocks

Operations to move, invert (mirror), copy, rotate and delete a block
are all available via the pop-up menu. In addition, the view can zoom
to the area described by the block.

The framework of the block is traced by moving the mouse while
holding down the left mouse button. The operation is executed when
the button is released.

By holding down one of the hotkeys `Shift` or `Ctrl`, or both keys
`Shift` and `Ctrl` together, while the block is drawn the operation
invert, rotate or delete is automatically selected as shown in the
table below:

[options="header"]
|====
| Action | Effect
| Left mouse button held down
| Trace framework to move block
| `Shift` + Left mouse button held down
| Trace framework for invert block
| `Ctrl` + Left mouse button held down
| Trace framework for rotating block 90°
| `Shift` + `Ctrl` + Left mouse button held down
| Trace framework to delete the block
| Centre mouse button held down
| Trace framework to zoom to block
|====

When moving a block:

* Move block to new position and operate left mouse button to place
  the elements.
* To cancel the operation use the right mouse button
  and select Cancel Block from the menu (or press the `Esc` key).

Alternatively if no key is pressed when drawing the block use the
right mouse button to display the pop-up menu and select the
required operation.

For each block operation a selection window enables the action to be
limited to only some elements.

=== Selection of grid size

During element layout the cursor moves on a grid. The grid can be turned on or off using the icon on the left toolbar.

Any of the pre-defined grid sizes, or a User Defined grid, can be
chosen using the pop-up window, or the drop-down selector on the
toolbar at the top of the screen. The size of the User Defined grid
is set using the menu bar option Dimensions -> User Grid Size.

=== Adjustment of the zoom level

The zoom level can be changed using any of the following methods:

* Open the pop-up window (using the right mouse button) and then select the desired zoom.

* Use the following function keys:

** `F1`: Enlarge (zoom in)

** `F2`: Reduce (zoom out)

** `F3`: Redraw the display

** `F4`: Centre view at the current cursor position

* Rotate the mouse wheel.

* Hold down the middle mouse button and draw a rectangle to zoom to the described area.

=== Displaying cursor coordinates

The cursor coordinates are displayed in inches or millimetres as selected using the 'In' or 'mm' icons on the left hand side toolbar.

Whichever unit is selected Pcbnew always works to a precision of 1/10,000 of inch.

The status bar at the bottom of the screen gives:

* The current zoom setting.
* The absolute position of the cursor.
* The relative position of the cursor. Note the relative coordinates (x,y) can be set to (0,0) at any position by pressing the space bar. The cursor position is then displayed relative to this new datum.

In addition the relative position of the cursor can be displayed using its polar co-ordinates (ray + angle). This can be turned on and off using the icon in the left hand side toolbar.

=== Keyboard commands - hotkeys

Many commands are accessible directly with the keyboard. Selection can be either upper or lower case. Most hot keys are shown in menus. Some hot keys that do not appear are:

* `Delete`: deletes a footprint or a track. (_Available only if the Footprint mode or the Track mode is active_)
* `V`: if the track tool is active switches working layer or place via, if a track is in progress.
* `+` and `-`: select next or previous layer.
* `?`: display the list of all hot keys.
* `Space`: reset relative coordinates.

=== Operation on blocks

Operations to move, invert (mirror), copy, rotate and delete a block
are all available from the pop-up menu. In addition, the view can
zoom to that described by the block.

The framework of the block is traced by moving the mouse while
holding down the left mouse button. The operation is executed when
the button is released.

By holding down one of the keys `Shift` or `Ctrl`, both `Shift` and
`Ctrl` together, or `Alt`, while the block is drawn the operation
invert, rotate, delete or copy is automatically selected as shown in
the table below:

[options="header"]
|====
| Action | Effect
| Left mouse button held down
| Move block
| `Shift` + Left mouse button held down
| Invert (mirror) block
| `Ctrl` + Left mouse button held down
| Rotate block 90°
| `Shift` + `Ctrl` + Left mouse button held down
| Delete the block
| `Alt` + Left mouse button held down
| Copy the block
|====

When a block command is made, a dialog window is displayed, and
items involved in this command can be chosen.

Any of the commands above can be cancelled via the same pop-up menu
or by pressing the Escape key (`Esc`).

image::images/Pcbnew_legacy_block_selection_dialog.png[scaledwidth="70%"]

=== Units used in dialogs

Units used to display dimensions values are inch and mm. The desired
unit can be selected by pressing the icon located in left toolbar:
image:images/icons/unit_inch.png[] image:images/icons/unit_mm.png[]
However one can enter the unit used to define a value, when entering
a new value.

Accepted units are:

|====
| 1 *in*  | 1 inch
| 1 *"*   | 1 inch
| 25 *th* | 25 thou
| 25 *mi* | 25 mils, same as thou
| 6 *mm*  | 6 mm
|====

The rules are:

* Spaces between the number and the unit are accepted.
* Only the first two letters are significant.
* In countries using an alternative decimal separator than the period, the period (`.`) can be used as well. Therefore `1,5` and `1.5` are the same in French.

=== Top menu bar

The top menu bar provides access to the files (loading and saving), configuration options, printing, plotting and the help files.

=== Pop-up windows and fast editing

A right-click of the mouse opens a pop-up window. Its contents
depends on the element pointed at by the cursor.

This gives immediate access to:

* Changing the display (centre display on cursor, zoom in or out or
  selecting the zoom).
* Setting the grid size.
* Additionally a right-click on an element enables editing of the most
  commonly modified element parameters.

The screenshots below show what the pop-up windows looks like.

=== Available modes

There are 3 modes when using pop-up menus. In the pop-up menus,
these modes add or remove some specific commands.
