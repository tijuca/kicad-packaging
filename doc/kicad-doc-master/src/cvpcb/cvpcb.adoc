== Introduction to CvPcb

CvPcb is a tool that allows you to associate components in your
schematic to component footprints used when laying out the printed
circuit board. This association is added to the net list file created by
the schematic capture program Eeschema.

The net list file generated by Eeschema specifies which printed circuit board footprint
is associated with each component in the schematic only when the footprint field
of the component is initialized.

This is the case when component footprints are associated during schematic capture
by setting the component's footprint field, or it is set in the schematic library
when loading the symbol.

CvPcb provides a convenient method of associating footprints to components
during schematic capture.
It provides footprint list filtering, footprint viewing, and 3D component model
viewing to help ensure the correct footprint is associated with each component.

Components can be assigned to their corresponding footprints manually or
automatically by creating equivalence files (.equ files).
Equivalence files are lookup tables associating each component with it's footprint.

This interactive approach is simpler and less error prone than directly
associating the footprints in the schematic editor.

CvPcb allows you to see the list of available footprints and to display them
on the screen to ensure you are associating the correct footprint.

**It can be run only from Eeschema**, from the top toolbar, either when
Eeschema is started from the KiCad project manager or when Eeschema is
started as a stand alone application.

Running CvPcb from Eeschema launched from the KiCad Manager is generally
better because:

* Cvpcb needs the project config file to know the footprint libraries to
  load.

* Cvpcb initializes the components footprint fields of the current
  schematic project. This is possible only if the project file is in the
  same path as the open schematic.

Launching CvPcb from an Eeschema launched from the KiCad manager assures
automatically all this.

WARNING: You actually *can* launch CvPcb from a stand alone Eeschema
session though, but please note that any schematic opened that does not
have a project file in the same path may be missing components due to
missing libraries which will not show up in CvPcb. If there is no
fp-lib-table file in the same path as the open schematic, no project
specific footprint libraries will be available either.

== CvPcb Features

=== Manual or Automatic Association

CvPcb allows for interactive assignment (manual) as well as automatic
assignment via equivalence files.

== Invoking CvPcb

*CvPcb is only invoked from the schematic capture program Eeschema*, by the tool:

image:images/icons/run-cvpcb.png[run cvpcb]

Eeschema automatically passes the correct data (component list and footprints) to CvPcb.
There is no update to do (unless some new components are not yet annotated), just run Cvpcb.

== CvPcb Commands

=== Main Screen

The image below shows the main window of CvPcb.

image::images/en/cvpcb_main_window.png[scaledwidth="90%"]

The left pane contains the list of available footprint library file
names associated with the project. The center pane contains the list of
components loaded from the net list file. The right pane contains the
list of available footprints loaded from the project footprint libraries.
The component pane will be empty if no netlist file has been loaded
and the footprint pane can be also empty if no footprint libraries are
found.

=== Main Window Toolbar

=== CvPcb Configuration

image::images/en/cvpcb_preference_menu.png[scaledwidth="35%"]

CvPcb can be automatically closed after saving the footprint association
file, or not.

Invoking the ``Libraries'' entry in the ``Preferences'' menu displays
the library configuration dialog.

Depending on the CvPcb version, there are 2 different methods of library
management:

- The legacy management, using *.mod files, and a library list of files.

- The new ``Pretty'' format, using one file by footprint. It uses a
  folder list. Each folder (*.pretty folder name) is a library. When
  using this new method of library management, You can also use native libraries originating
  from GEDA/GPCB or even Eagle xml format files.

== Using CvPcb to Associate Components with Footprints

=== Manually Associating Footprints with Components

To manually associate a footprint with a component first select a
component in the component pane. Then select a footprint in the
footprint pane by double-clicking the left mouse button on the name of
the desired footprint. The unassigned next component in the list is
automatically selected. Changing the component footprint is performed in
the same manner.

=== Filtering the Footprint List

If the selected component and/or library is highlighted when the one or
more of the filtering option is enabled, the displayed footprint list
in CvPcb is filtered accordingly.

The icons image:images/icons/filter_component.png[]
image:images/icons/filter_pincount.png[]
image:images/icons/filter_library.png[] enable and disable the
filtering feature. When the filtering is not enabled, the full footprint
list is shown.

Without filtering:

image::images/en/filter_none.png[scaledwidth="80%"]

Filtered by list of footprint filters assigned to the selected
component. The component filters are listed on the center pane of the
status bar at the bottom of the main window.

Filtered by the footprint filter of the selected component:

image::images/en/filter_comp.png[scaledwidth="80%"]

In the component library editor in Eeschema, the footprint list was set
using the entries in the footprint filter tab of the component
properties dialog as shown below.

image::images/en/eeschema_filter.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

Filtered by the pin count of the selected component:

image::images/en/filter_pincount.png[scaledwidth="80%"]

Filtered by the selected library.

image::images/en/filter_library.png[scaledwidth="80%"]

The filtering can be combined to form more complex
filtering to help reduce the number of footprints in the footprint pane.

Filtered by the selected component pin count and the component filter:

image::images/en/filter_comp_and_pincount.png[scaledwidth="80%"]

<<<<<

== Automatic Associations

=== Equivalence files

Equivalence files allow for automatic assignment of footprints to
components.

They list the name of the corresponding footprint according
to the name (__value field__) of the component. These files typically
have the *.equ* file extension.

They are plain text files and may be edited by using any plain text editor,
and must be created by the user.



=== Equivalence File Format

Equivalence files consist of one line for each component. Each line has
the following structure:

*`component value' `footprint name'*

Each name must be single quoted by the ' character and the component and
footprint names must be separated by one or more spaces.

_Example:_

If the U3 component is circuit 14011 and its footprint is 14DIP300, the
line is:

+`14011' `14DIP300'+

Any line starting with *#* is a comment.

Here is an example equivalence file:

-----------------------------------------------
#integrated circuits (smd):
'74LV14' 'SO14E'
'74HCT541M' 'SO20L'
'EL7242C' 'SO8E'
'DS1302N' 'SO8E'
'XRC3064' 'VQFP44'
'LM324N' 'S014E'
'LT3430' 'SSOP17'
'LM358' 'SO8E'
'LTC1878' 'MSOP8'
'24LC512I/SM' 'SO8E'
'LM2903M' 'SO8E'
'LT1129_SO8' 'SO8E'
'LT1129CS8-3.3' 'SO8E'
'LT1129CS8' 'SO8E'
'LM358M' 'SO8E'
'TL7702BID' 'SO8E'
'TL7702BCD' 'SO8E'
'U2270B' 'SO16E'
#Xilinx
'XC3S400PQ208' 'PQFP208'
'XCR3128-VQ100' 'VQFP100'
'XCF08P' 'BGA48'

#upro
'MCF5213-LQFP100' 'VQFP100'

#regulators
'LP2985LV' 'SOT23-5'
-----------------------------------------------


=== Automatically Associating Footprints to Components

Click on the automatic footprint association button on the top toolbar
to process an equivalence file.

_All components found by their value in the selected equivalence (*.equ) file
will have their footprint automatically assigned._
