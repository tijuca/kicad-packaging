"CvPcb is a tool that allows you to associate components in your schematic to "
"component footprints used when laying out the printed circuit board. This "
"association is added to the net list file created by the schematic capture "
"program Eeschema."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: cvpcb.adoc:50
msgid ""
"The net list file generated by Eeschema specifies which printed circuit "
"board footprint is associated with each component in the schematic only when "
"the footprint field of the component is initialized."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: cvpcb.adoc:54
msgid ""
"This is the case when component footprints are associated during schematic "
"capture by setting the component's footprint field, or it is set in the "
"schematic library when loading the symbol."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: cvpcb.adoc:59
msgid ""
"CvPcb provides a convenient method of associating footprints to components "
"during schematic capture.  It provides footprint list filtering, footprint "
"viewing, and 3D component model viewing to help ensure the correct footprint "
"is associated with each component."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: cvpcb.adoc:63
msgid ""
"Components can be assigned to their corresponding footprints manually or "
"automatically by creating equivalence files (.equ files).  Equivalence files "
"are lookup tables associating each component with it's footprint."

"This interactive approach is simpler and less error prone than directly "
"associating the footprints in the schematic editor."
