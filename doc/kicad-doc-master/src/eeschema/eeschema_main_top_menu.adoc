[[preferences-menu-libs-and-dir]]
==== Preferences menu / Component Libraries

image:images/en/libsettings.png[Library settings]

This dialog is used to configure component libraries and search paths.
The configuration parameters are saved in the .pro file. Different
configuration files in different directories are also possible.

Eeschema searches, in order:

1.  The configuration file (projectname.pro) in the current directory.
2.  The kicad.pro configuration file in the KiCad directory. This file
can thus be the default configuration.
3.  Default values if no file is found. It will at least then be
necessary to fill out the list of libraries to load, and then save the
configuration.

The 'Check for cache/library conflicts at schematic load' box is used to configure
the library conflict rescue behavior. See <<rescuing-cached-components,Rescuing Cached Components>> for more information about that.

|Default line width: |Pen size used to draw objects that do not have a
specified pen size.

|Default text size: |Text size used when creating new text items or labels

|Repeat draw item horizontal displacement a|
increment on X axis during element duplication (usual value 0)

(after placing an item like a component, label or wire,::
  a duplication is made by the _Insert_ key)

|Repeat draw item vertical displacement |increment on Y axis during
element duplication (usual value is 0.100 inches or 2,54 mm)

|Repeat label increment: |Increment of label value during duplication of texts ending
in a number, such as bus members (usual value 1 or -1).

|Show Grid: |If checked: display grid.

|Show hidden pins: |Display invisible (or __hidden__) pins, typically power pins. If checked,
allows the display of power pins.

|Limit panning to scroll size |When enabled, the middle mouse
button cannot move the sheet area outside the displayed area.

|Pan while moving object |If checked, automatically shifts the window
if the cursor leaves the window during drawing or moving.

If checked, buses and wires can only be vertical or horizontal.

Otherwise, buses and wires can be placed at any orientation.
