"One of the most powerful features of the footprint library table is "

"$KISYSMOD` environment variable.  This points to where the default footprint "
"libraries that were installed with KiCad are located.  You can override `"
"$KISYSMOD` by defining it yourself which allows you to substitute your own "
"libraries in place of the default KiCad footprint libraries.  When a board "
