How-to use
==========
The kicad_flowchart.dia can be opened with the free and open-source application Dia.

Note
----
In the flowchart I use png files which are exported from the bitmap svg files.
The resolution of each PNG file used, is exactly 40 x 40 pixels.

Exporting
=========
When you exporting the Dia file, please,
choose: "PNG (anti-aliased)" as file format before pressing the Save button.

When a pop-up appears with Export options, enter width: '1150'. Press Export.
