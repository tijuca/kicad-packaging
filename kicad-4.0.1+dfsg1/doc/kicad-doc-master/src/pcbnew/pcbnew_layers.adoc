== Setting up working layers

Pcbnew can work on 50 different layers:

* 32 copper layers (for routing of tracks).
* 14 technical layers (includes 1 board outline layer).
* 4 auxiliary layers.

The number of copper layers, and if needed their names and
attributes, should be set. Unused technical layers can be disabled.

=== Select copper layers

==== Introduction

Copper layers are the usual working layers used by the automatic
router to place and re-arrange tracks. Layer 0 is the copper
(solder) layer. Layer 31 is the component layer. Other layers are
the inner layers, from In1 to In30.

==== Select number of layers

To enable navigation between layers, it is necessary to select the
number of working layers. To do this you can use the menu bar and
select Design Rules -> Layers Setup.

Then select the number of layers wanted, from 2 to 32.

==== Copper layers

The name of any copper layer is editable. Copper layers have
attributes useful when using the external router _Freerouter_.

=== Auxiliary technical layers

Some are associated in pairs, others not. When they appear as a pair
this affects the behaviour of footprints. The elements making up a
footprint (pads, drawing and text) appearing on a layer (solder or
component), appear on the other complementary layer when the footprint
is inverted (mirrored).

The technical layers are:

==== Paired layers

* The *Adhesives* layers (Copper and Component):

** These are used in the application of adhesive to stick SMD components
   to the circuit board, generally before wave soldering.

* The *Solder Paste*  layers paste SMD (Copper and Component):

** Used to produce a mask to allow solder paste to be placed on the
   pads of surface mount components, generally before reflow soldering.
   Usually only surface mount pads occupy these layers.

* The *Silk Screen* layers (Copper and Component):

** They are the layers where the drawings of the components appear.

* The *Solder Mask* layers (Copper and Component):

** These define the solder masks. Normally all pads appear on one or
   the other of these layers (or both for through pads) to prevent the
   varnish covering the pads.

==== Layers for general use

* Comments
* E.C.O. 1
* E.C.O. 2
* Drawings

These layers are for any use. They can be used for text such as
instructions for assembly or wiring, or construction drawings, to be
used to create a file for assembly or machining.

==== Special layer

* *Edge Cuts* layer:

** This layer is reserved for the drawing of circuit board outline. Any
   element (graphic, texts...) placed on this layer appears on all the
   other layers. Use this layer only to draw board outlines.

=== Selection of the active layer

The selection of the active working layer can be done in several ways:

* Using the right toolbar (Layer manager).
* Using the upper toolbar.
* With the pop-up window (activated with the right mouse button).
* Using the + and - keys (works on copper layers only).
* By hot keys.

==== Selection using the layer manager

==== Selection using the upper toolbar

image::images/Pcbnew_layer_selection_dropdown.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

This directly selects the working layer.

Hot keys to select the working layer are displayed.

==== Selection using the pop-up window

image::images/Pcbnew_layer_selection_popup.png[scaledwidth="40%"]

The Pop-up window opens a menu window which provides a choice for
the working layer.

=== Selection of the Layers for Vias

If the *Add Tracks and Vias* icon is selected on the right hand
toolbar, the Pop-Up window provides the option to change the layer
pair used for vias:

This selection opens a menu window which provides choice of the
layers used for vias.

image::images/Pcbnew_via_layer_pair_dialog.png[scaledwidth="40%"]

When a via is placed the working (active) layer is automatically
switched to the alternate layer of the layer pair used for the vias.

One can also switch to an other active layer by hot keys, and if a
track is in progress, a via will be inserted.

=== Using the high-contrast mode

This mode is entered when the tool (in the left toolbar) is activated:
image:images/icons/contrast_mode.png[]

When using this mode, the active layer is displayed like in the
normal mode, but all others layers are displayed in gray color.

There are two useful cases:

==== Copper layers in high-contrast mode

When a board uses more than four layers, this option allows the
active copper layer to be seen more easily:

*Normal mode* (back side copper layer active):

*High-contrast mode* (back side copper layer active):

image::images/Pcbnew_copper_layers_contrast_high.png[scaledwidth="90%"]

==== Technical layers

The other case is when it is necessary to examine solder paste
layers and solder mask layers which are usually not displayed.

Masks on pads are displayed if this mode is active.

*Normal mode* (front side solder mask layer active):

*High-contrast mode* (front side solder mask layer active):
