[[introduction-to-pl_editor]]
== Introduction to *Pl_Editor*

Pl_Editor is a page layout editor tool to create custom title blocks,
and frame references.

The title block, associated to frame references, and other graphic items
(logos) is called here a page layout

Basic page layout items are:

* *Lines*

* *Rectangles*

* *Texts* (with format symbols, that will be replaced by the actual text,
  like the date, page number...) in Eeschema or Pcbnew.

* *Poly-polygons* (mainly to place logos and special graphic shapes)

* *Bitmaps*.

WARNING: Bitmaps can be plotted only by few plotters (PDF and
PS only) Therefore, for other plotters, only a bounding box will be
plotted.

* Items can be repeated, and texts and poly_polygons can be rotated.

[[pl_editor-files]]
== Pl_Editor files

[[input-file-and-default-title-block]]
=== Input file and default title block

Pl_Editor reads or writes page layout description files *.kicad_wks
(KiCad worksheet).

An internal default page layout description to display the default KiCad
title block is used until a file is read

[[output-file]]
=== Output file

The current page layout description can be written in a **.kicad_wks*
file, using the S-expression format, which is widely used in KiCad.

This file can be used to show the custom page layout in Eeschema and/or
Pcbnew.

== Theory of operations

[[basic-page-layout-items-properties]]
=== Basic page layout items properties:

Basic page layout items are:

* *Lines*

* *Rectangles*

* *Texts* (with format symbols, with will be replaced by the actual
  text, like the date, page number...) in Eeschema or Pcbnew.

* *Poly-polygons* (mainly to place logos and special graphic shapes).
  These poly polygons are created by **Bitmap2component**, and cannot be
  built inside pl_editor, because it is not possible to create such shapes
  by hand.

* *Bitmaps* to place logos.

WARNING: Bitmaps can be plotted only by few plotters: PDF and PS only.

Therefore:

* *Texts, poly-polygons* and *bitmaps* are defined by a position, and
  can be rotated.

* *Lines* (in fact segments) and *rectangles* are defined by two points:
  a start point and a end point. They cannot be rotated (this is useless
  for segments)

These basic items can be repeated.

Texts which are repeated accept also an increment value for labels (has
meaning only if the text is one letter or one digit)

[[coordinates-definition]]
=== Coordinates definition

Each position, start point and end point of items is always relative to
a page corner.

**This feature ensure you can define a page layout which is not
dependent on the paper size**.

[[reference-corners-and-coordinates]]
=== Reference corners and coordinates:

image:images/en/page_property_1.png[]

* When the page size is changed, the position of the item, relative to
  its reference corner does not change.

* Usually, title blocks are attached to the right bottom corner, and
  therefore this corner is the default corner, when creating an item.

For rectangles and segments, which have two defined points, each point
has its reference corner.

<<<<<

[[rotation]]
=== Rotation

Items which have a position defined by just one point (texts and
poly-polygons) can be rotated:

Normal: Rotation = 0

image::images/en/text_noriented.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

Rotated: Rotation = 20 and 10 degrees.

image::images/en/text_rotated.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

<<<<<

[[repeat-option]]
=== Repeat option

Items can be repeated:

This is useful to create grid and grid labels.

image::images/en/page_property_2.png[scaledwidth="95%"]]

<<<<<

[[texts-and-formats]]
== Texts and formats

[[format-symbols]]
=== Format symbols:

Texts can be simple strings or can include format symbols.

Format symbols are replaced by the actual values in Eeschema or Pcbnew.

They are like format symbols in printf function.

A format symbol is *%* followed by 1 letter.

The *%C* format has one digit (comment identifier)

Formats symbols are:

*%% = replaced by %*

*%K = KiCad version*

*%Z = paper format name (A4, USLetter ...)*

*%Y = company name*

*%D = date*

*%R = revision*

*%S = sheet number*

*%N = number of sheets*

*%Cx = comment (x = 0 to 9 to identify the comment)*

*%F = filename*

*%P = sheet path (sheet full name, for Eeschema)*

*%T = title*

Example:

"Size: %Z" displays "Size: A4" or "Size: USLetter"

[[multi-line-texts]]
=== Multi-line texts:

Texts can be multi-line.

There are 2 ways to insert a new line in texts:

1.  Insert the "n" 2 chars sequence (mainly in Page setup dialog in
    KiCad)

2.  Insert a new line in Pl_Editor Design window.

Here is an example:

<<<<<

[[multi-line-texts-in-page-setup-dialog]]
=== Multi-line texts in Page Setup dialog:

In the page setup dialog, text controls do not accept a multi-line text.

The *"\n"* 2 chars sequence should be inserted to force a new line inside a
text.

Here is a two lines text, in _comment 2_ field:

image:images/en/insert_newline_code.png[]

Here is the actual text:

image:images/en/multi_line_2.png[]

However, if you really want the *"\n"* inside the text, enter *"\\n"*.

[[constraints]]
== Constraints

[[page-1-constraint]]
=== Page 1 constraint

When using Eeschema, the full schematic often uses more than one page.

Usually page layout items are displayed on all pages.

But if a user want some items to be displayed only on page 1, or not on
page 1, the "page 1 option" this is possible by setting this option:

image:images/en/display_options.png[]

Page 1 option:

* None: no constraint.

* Page 1 only: the items is visible only on page 1.

* Not on page 1: the items is visible on all pages but the page 1.

<<<<<

[[text-full-size-constraint]]
=== Text full size constraint

image:images/en/constraint_options.png[]

Only for texts, one can set 2 parameters :

* the max size X

* the max size Y

which define a bounding box

When these parameters are not 0, when displaying the text, the actual
text height and the actual text width are dynamically modified if the
full text size is bigger than the max size X and/or the max size Y, to
fit the full text size with this bounding box.

When the actual full text size is smaller than the max size X and/or the
max size Y, the text height and/or the text width is not modified.

The text with no bounding box. Max size X = 0,0 Max size Y = 0,0

image:images/en/constraints_none.png[]

The *same* text with constraint. Max size X = 40,0 Max size Y = 0,0

[[item-creation]]
=== Item creation

To add a new item, right click the mouse button when the cursor is on
the left window or the draw area.

A popup menu is displayed:

Pop up menu in left window

image::images/en/context_createnew.png[scaledwidth="35%"]

Pop up menu in draw area.

image::images/en/context_createnew2.png[scaledwidth="35%"]


Lines, rectangles and texts are added just by clicking on the
corresponding menu item.

Logos must first be created by Bitmap2component, which creates a page
layout description file.

The Append Page Layout Descr File option append this file, to insert the
logo (a poly polygon)

<<<<<

[[adding-lines-rectangles-and-texts]]
=== Adding lines, rectangles and texts

When clicking on the option, a dialog is opened:

Adding line or rectangle

image::images/en/dialog_newline.png[scaledwidth="35%"]

Adding text

image::images/en/dialog_newtext.png[scaledwidth="35%"]


Position of end points, and corner reference can be defined here.

However they can be defined later, from the right window, or by moving
the item, or one of its end points.

Most of time the corner reference is the same for both points.

If this is not the case, define the corner reference at creation is
better, because if a corner reference is changed later, the geometry of
the item will be a bit strange.

When an item is created, if is put in move mode, and you can refine its
position (this is very useful for texts and small lines or rectangles)

[[adding-logos]]
=== Adding logos

To add a logo, a poly polygon (the vectored image of the logo) must be
first created using Bitmap2component.

Bitmap2component creates a page layout description file which is append
to the current design, using the *Append Page Layout Descr File* option.

Bitmap2component creates a page layout description file which contains
only one item: a poly polygon.

__However, this command can be used to append any page layout
description file, which is merged with the current design__.

Once a poly polygon is inserted, it can be moved and its parameters
edited.

[[adding-image-bitmaps]]
=== Adding image bitmaps

You can add an image bitmap using most of bitmap formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP
...)

* When a bitmap is imported, its PPI (pixel per inch) definition is set
  to 300PPI

* This value can be modified in panel Properties (right panel).

* The actual size depend on this parameter.

* Be aware that using higher definition values brings larger output files,
  and can have a noticeable draw or plot time.

A bitmap can be repeated, **but not rotated**.
